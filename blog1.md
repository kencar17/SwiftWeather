#SwiftWeather

SwiftWeather  is an iOS weather app developed in Swift 2. 

## Install Instructions That worked for me.

  Once I decided to work on this application I forked the project into a repo in under my account, and then
cloned the project down to my local machine to begin working on it.

###These are the steps I took to get the project to work on my machine:

- Step One: Clone the project down to my machine via command line. The following screen shot illustrates
             the pod cloning of the repo down to my machine.

- Step Two: Next I cd in SwiftWeather, and had to do a pod install to install the necessary dependencies. The 
            following screen shot illustrates thr pod install.

- Step Three: Now I had to cd  into "SwiftWeather.xcworkspace", and make a directory called .access_tokens and 
              echo in an appID. To get the appId I had to sign up on [openweathermap.org/appid](http://openweathermap.org/appid.
