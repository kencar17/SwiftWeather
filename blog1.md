SwiftWeather  is an iOS weather app developed in Swift 2. 

## Install Instructions That worked for me.

  Once I decided to work on this application I forked the project into a repo in under my account, and then
cloned the project down to my local machine to begin working on it.

###These are the steps I took to get the project to work on my machine:

- Step One: Clone the project down to my machine via command line.
